Setting up Vim with YouCompleteMe

07 November 2013

YouCompleteMe is basically better omni-completion for Vim; it finds matches in the current file you are editing. It is great for both coding generally, and writing using LaTeX..

For best results, compile Vim from source, with Python enabled:

hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim
cd vim/
./configure --enable-pythoninterp
make -j8
sudo make install
If you get an error saying you need a terminal library such as ncurses, install one, and try the above again:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
We will let vundle do all of the hard work for us in managing the installation and setup of YouCompleteMe. Put this inside your ~/.vimrc file:

syntax on
set clipboard=unnamed
set number
set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab

set nocompatible
filetype off

set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
call vundle#rc()

Bundle 'gmarik/vundle'
Bundle 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'

filetype plugin indent on 
First download vundle:

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
And then YouCompleteMe:

git clone https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.git ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
git submodule update --init --recursive
./install.sh --clang-completer
Finally, run the following command in a terminal to finalise everythingi:

vim +BundleInstall +qall
